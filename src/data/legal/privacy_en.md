# Tulaa — Privacy Policy

**Version 1.0 · Effective 2025-09-16**

> **Short version:** Your logs stay on your device. Analytics and crash reports are off by default.
> With your consent, anonymous crash logs (Sentry) and event analytics (PostHog) help us improve
> stability and features — never your journals or period data. No ads. No personal data.

## 1) What We Collect

* **By default:** nothing leaves your device.
* **If you opt in:**
    * Anonymous analytics with PostHog (feature usage events, basic device info — never personal
      notes).
    * Anonymous crash reports with Sentry (technical details like device model, OS, and stack
      traces — never your personal health logs).

## 2) What Stays on Your Device

Yoga logs, water logs, moments/journals, rhythms, and period data. Private to your device unless you
export/share them.

## 3) How We Use Data

To improve stability (via crash reports) and features (via analytics). Both are optional, anonymous,
and only used to understand general usage patterns. Never for advertising, profiling, or resale.

## 4) Permissions

Notifications are used only if you set up Rhythms. No access to contacts, camera, or location.

## 5) Third Parties

* [Sentry](https://sentry.io/privacy) — error/crash reporting
* [PostHog](https://posthog.com/privacy) — anonymous, opt-in product analytics

## 6) Retention

Local data stays until you delete it or uninstall the app. Crash logs are typically retained ~90
days. PostHog analytics events are retained only as long as needed for product improvement (
typically up to 90 days).

## 7) Security

Local data is sandboxed. Cached media may be encrypted at rest. We don’t store or transmit personal
identifiers.

## 8) Children

Not intended for children under 16. Teens 16–18 may use with parental guidance.

## 9) Your Controls

* Export your data any time.
* Delete local data any time.
* Toggle analytics and crash reports on/off any time.

## 10) Changes

You’ll see a notice in the app whenever we update this policy.
